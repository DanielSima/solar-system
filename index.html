			A solar system is a star and all of the objects that travel around it—planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Most stars host their own planets, so there are likely tens of billions of other solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy alone. Solar systems can also have more than one star. These are called binary star systems if there are two stars, or multi-star systems if there are three or more stars.<br />
			The solar system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the vast Milky Way galaxy. It consists of the Sun (our star) and everything that orbits around it. This includes the eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon), dwarf planets and their satellites, as well as asteroids, comets and countless particles of smaller debris. This video will surely explain it better.

	<div class="outterBox">
		<p class="planetTextLeft">Our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula—a spinning, swirling disk of material.<br />
			At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99 percent of the available matter.<br />
			Matter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets and large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons</p>

			<span class="titletext">Mercury</span>
			is the closest planet to the Sun. It orbits in a highly elliptical orbit ranging from 46 million km (29 million miles) from the Sun out to 70 million km (43.5 million miles).<br />
			It takes about 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun but rotates on its axis once every 59 Earth days. Because of the slow rotation, a single day on Mercury (mid day to mid day) takes 176 Earth days. Its axial tilt is remarkably small at 3/100ths of a degree. Much smaller than any other planet.<br />
			Mercury is quite small with a diameter of 4,878km, (2/5ths that of Earth) and only 5% of Earth’s mass. Its gravity on the surface is 1/3rd of Earth’s.<br />
			Mercury has almost no atmosphere and is blasted by the Sun during the day and exposed to cold space during the night. This means that it undergoes some of the widest temperature swings of any body in the Solar System with temperatures reaching +430 C and dipping down to -180 C.<br />
			It has a highly cratered rocky surface and is known to have an iron core. However its magnetic field is much weaker than the Earth’s (1% as strong). Initially RADAR waves reflected from the surface of Mercury indicated that water ice might be present at the poles. It has recently been confirmed by the Messenger Spacecraft that ice water does indeed exist in deep craters at the poles the interiors of which are permanently shrouded in shadow.</p>

			<span class="titletext">Venus</span>
			is the second closest planet to the Sun and orbits in an almost circular orbit at 108 million km. As it orbits, Venus comes closer to Earth than any other planet in the solar system and can come to within about 40 million km.<br />
			Venus takes about 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun and rotates at the incredibly slow rate of once every 243 days - and in a clockwise direction (as seen from looking down on the Suns north pole). Only Uranus (which almost spins on its side) also has a clockwise spin. A day on Venus (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 117 Earth days.<br />
			Venus has a gentle axial tilt of 3 degrees.<br />
			Venus, with a diameter of 12100 km, it is very nearly the same size as Earth (1000km smaller), and has 80% of Earth’s mass. its gravity on the surface is 90% that of Earth’s.<br />
			Venus has a very dense atmosphere with pressures at the surface over 90 times that of Earth’s. The atmosphere is comprised of carbon dioxide with thick clouds of sulphur dioxide. This atmosphere has the strongest greenhouse effect known in the solar system which keeps the planet at a reasonably constant temperature of 460 degrees C. This makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, far hotter even then mercury which is twice as close to the Sun.<br />
			The surface of Venus, although hidden from view by thick clouds, has been mapped using radar and it is known that is is covered by large flat volcanic plains with two higher areas of land (continents) with mountains and valleys. The surface also shows impact craters and volcano like structures. Venus has a very weak magnetic field.</p>

			<span class="titletext">Earth</span>
			is the third closest planet to the Sun and is the largest and densest of the inner planets. Earth orbits in a reasonably circular at 150 million km and is the first of the planets to have a moon. Earth is of course the only place that we know of that has life.<br />
			Earth takes 365.25 Earth days to orbit the Sun and rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. Because it rotates around the Sun the length of a day on Earth (sunrise to sunrise) takes 24 hours.<br />
			The Earth has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees and a diameter of 12742km.<br />
			The Earth is thought to be 4.54 billion years old and has been accompanied by the Moon for most of that time. It is believed that the Moon was formed when a large Mars sized body impacted the Earth causing enough material to be ejected which eventually coalesced into the Moon. The Moon has had the effect of stabilising Earth’s axial tilt and is the source of the Earth’s ocean tides.<br />
			The Moon is 3,474km in diameter (27% that of Earth) and orbits at a distance of between about 362,000 to 405,000 km. It has also been affected by the gravitational pull of the Earth which has over time caused the Moon's rotation to be slowed until it matches the time it takes to orbit the Earth. This is why the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth.<br />
			Earth is protected from solar radiation by a strong magnetic field generated by movement of its core which is mainly comprised of molten iron.</p>

			<span class="titletext">Mars</span>
			is the fourth closest planet to the Sun and orbits in an fairly eccentric orbit at around 230 (+-20) million km.<br />
			Mars takes about 686 Earth days to orbit the Sun. It has a tilt (25.1 degrees) and rotational period (24 hour 37 minutes) which are both similar to the Earth with a day (sunrise to sunrise) lasting 24 hours, 39 mins. Because of the tilt it also has seasons in the same way as the Earth does.<br />
			Mars is about half the size of the Earth with a diameter of 6,792km. However its mass is only a tenth of Earth’s with gravity on the surface being around 37% that of Earth’s.<br />
			Because Mars no longer has a magnetic field to protect it, Mars has lost its original atmosphere due to the effects of the solar wind interacting with the atmosphere causing atoms to be lost into space. Spacecraft have detected streams of atoms trailing off into space behind Mars. As a result the atmospheric pressure on Mars is 1% that on Earth. It is comprised of mostly (95%) carbon dioxide. Mars is very cold. Not only is it about 1.5 times further from the Sun than Earth, it also has a thin atmosphere which cannot store much heat. Because of this the temperature ranges from about -87 degrees C in winter up to a maximum of -5 degrees C in summer.<br />
			Mars is very dusty and prone to huge dust storms which can envelop the entire planet. These are more likely to occur when the planet is closest to the Sun.</p>

			<span class="titletext">Jupiter</span>
			is the fifth closest planet to the Sun and is the first of what are called the outer planets (being outside the asteroid belt). It is by far the largest planet in the solar system having two and a half times as much mass as all the other planets put together and one thousandth the mass of the Sun. This is so large that the Sun and Jupiter actually orbit each other about a point just outside of the Suns surface.<br />
			Jupiter orbits the Sun once very 12 years (at about 780 million km) and is comprised of gas (75% hydrogen and 24% helium) and is presumed to have a rocky core surrounded by a sea of liquid metallic hydrogen which forms a ball 110,000km in diameter. Jupiter’s total diameter is 142,984 km.<br />
			In the upper atmosphere is a cloud layer 50km thick. The clouds are comprised of ammonia crystals and other compounds which are arranged into bands moving at different speeds at different latitudes. The Great Red Spot is a large stable storm vortex laying between two layers.<br />
			Considering its size, Jupiter rotates very quickly at one rotation at just under once every 10 hours. This means that at the equator there is quite a large centrifugal force which means the planet has a pronounced bulge - its diameter around the equator is 9000km greater than the diameter measured at the poles.</p>

		<p class="planetTextRight">
			<span class="titletext">Saturn</span>
			is the sixth closest planet to the Sun. It is the second largest planet in the solar system having a radius 9 times that of Earth (57,000 km) and a mass 95 times that of Earth.<br />
			Saturn orbits the Sun once very 29 years (at about 1400 million km) and is mainly comprised of gas (96% hydrogen and 3% helium) and is presumed to have a rocky core surrounded by a sea of liquid metallic hydrogen which forms a ball some 56,000km in diameter. The upper layers are thought to comprise of liquid water, ammonium hydrosulfide, hydrogen and helium.<br />
			Saturn's core is quite hot (11,700 degrees C) and it generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. The further from the planets centre, the less the temperature with the temperature reaching around -180 degrees in the upper atmosphere, and 0 degrees C at around 350km deep.<br />
			The cloud layers of Saturn are similar to those of Jupiter except that the banding is weaker and wider. Saturn also has a short lived but periodical storm called the great white spot which seems to occur every Saturnian year.<br />
			Saturn rotates at around 10 hours 39 minutes. The precise figure (like that of all gas giants) is not certain since there are several ways of measuring the rotation of a body which has no fixed visual references.</p>

			<span class="titletext">Uranus</span>
			is the seventh closest planet to the Sun and the third largest and fourth heaviest of the planets. It diameter (50,000km) is four times that of Earth with a mass over 14 times that of Earth.<br />
			Uranus orbits the Sun once very 84 years (at about 2900 million km) but is unusual in that it spins on its side (with an axial tilt of 97 degrees). This means that its moons and also its faint ring system also orbit in plane perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic.<br />
			It is believed to be comprised of a small rocky core surrounded by a deep mantle of water, ammonia and methane. This is in turn surrounded by an atmosphere of hydrogen, helium and methane with an upper cloud layer. Another oddity in Uranus is the fact that it is very cold. All the other gas giant planets emit more heat radiation than they receive due to very hot cores, but Uranus does not. A temperature of -224 degrees C has been measured in Uranus' atmosphere - the coldest in the solar system.</p>

		<p class="planetTextRight">
			<span class="titletext">Neptune</span>
			is the eighth closest planet to the Sun and is (since the relegation of Pluto) the last Planet in the Solar System. It is similar in size and composition to Uranus with a diameter of 49,000km and a mass of over 17 times that of Earth.<br />
			Uranus orbits the Sun once very 165 years at about 4500 million km. This is 30 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth which means that the strength of sunlight at Neptune is 1% of its strength at Earth. Neptune spins on an axis with a tilt of 28 degrees, which is quite similar to that of the Earth, every 16 hours.<br />
			Unlike Uranus' almost completely bland cloud layer, Neptune's weather systems are more pronounced with great dark spot storm systems being seen in the southern and northern hemispheres and other visible banding. Wind speeds of up to 600m/s have also been observed. Due to its great distance from the Sun, it is not surprising that the planet is one of the coldest with temperatures of -220 degrees C in the upper atmosphere. The core is thought to be at around 5200 degrees C.</p>

	<div class="outterBox">
		<p class="planetTextLeft">The Sun is now a middle aged star, with 9 planets and many other bodies near it in the solar system. In another 5 billion years, scientists think that the Sun will become much larger as energy from within makes the outer layers of the Sun expand, eventually becoming red giant. As this happens, most of the inner planets will be destroyed (including Earth). Eventually, after another 100 million years, the Sun will no longer be able to make energy, and will become a white dwarf, the size of a small planet.</p>
